===============================

Part of Udacity Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

This was a tough assignment using the HTML5 canvas and Object oriented Javascript to build a browser interactive game. The game engine was provided, however there was much to do to get it started and developed into a functioning game. Many late nights!

To run the game simply clone the repository and open index.html.

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible!
Use the arrow keys to move the player (left, right, up and down). Move the player up towards the water across the path but watch out for the bugs! Reaching the water scores one point. If you are quick you can catch a fish for an extra ten points. Each time you bump into a bug, you lose a life - you have ten lives and when they are all gone it's game over! Refresh the page to play again.

Full instructions are on the index.html page. Hope you like it!

Much inspiration and valuable insights from the following. Thanks guys!
