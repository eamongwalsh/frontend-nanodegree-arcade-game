===============================

Part of Udacity Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

This was a tough assignment using the HTML5 canvas and Object oriented Javascript to build a browser interactive game. The game engine was provided, however there was much to do to get it started and developed into a functioning game. Many late nights!

To run the game simply clone the repository and open index.html. Instructions are on that page. Hope you like it!

Much inspiration and valuable insights from the following. Thanks guys!
